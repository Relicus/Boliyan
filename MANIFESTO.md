# The Boliyan Manifesto

**"Boliyan"** — Speak your price. Seal the deal. No nonsense.

## 🚀 Mission
To build the most **efficient, transparent, and safe** peer-to-peer marketplace for Pakistan. We are killing the friction of buying and selling used goods. We believe that selling your old phone or buying a dining table shouldn't feel like a battle.

## 🛑 The Pain Points We Solve

### 1. The "Is this available?" Epidemic
**Problem:** Sellers get 50 messages asking "Available?", reply "Yes", and never hear back.
**Solution:** 
- **NO CHAT BEFORE DEAL.** 
- Buyers cannot message sellers directly. They must **Place a Bid**. 
- Chat unlocks *only* after the Seller **Accepts** the bid.
- This eliminates "window shoppers" and forces intent.

### 2. The Lowball Nightmare
**Problem:** You list a phone for 50k. Someone messages: "15k final cash now."
**Solution:** Automated Price Intelligence. We show the *real* market value. Lowball bids are auto-filtered or shamed (subtly).

### 3. The Trust Deficit
**Problem:** Meeting a stranger in a parking lot is scary. Is the item stolen? Is the buyer real?
**Solution:**
- **Verified Profiles:** Phone number + Social verification.
- **Rating History:** Your reputation follows you.
- **Safety Zones:** Suggested safe meetup spots.

### 4. Ad Clutter & Scams
**Problem:** Real listings get buried under "Earn Money Online" spam and duplicate ads.
**Solution:** Strict approval queues and community moderation. One unique item = One clean listing.

## ⚖️ The Rules of Engagement (Brand Values)

1.  **Respect the Time:** Don't ghost. If you change your mind, hit "Cancel Bid". It takes 1 second.
2.  **Real Prices Only:** No "Price: Rs 1" listings. Ask for what you want.
3.  **Data Privacy First:** We don't sell your phone number to telemarketers. Ever.
4.  **Community Policing:** See a scam? Flag it. We ban bad actors instantly.
