# Boliyan

**Boliyan** — Speak your price. Seal the deal. No nonsense.

## 🚀 Our Mission
To build the most **efficient, transparent, and safe** peer-to-peer marketplace for Pakistan. We are killing the friction of buying and selling used goods. We believe that selling your old phone or buying a dining table shouldn't feel like a battle.

## 🛑 The Pain Points We Solve
- **The "Is this available?" Epidemic**: No chat before deal. Messaging unlocks ONLY after a bid is accepted.
- **The Lowball Nightmare**: Automated Price Intelligence and mandatory 70% minimum bids.
- **The Trust Deficit**: Verified profiles and community-policed safety.
