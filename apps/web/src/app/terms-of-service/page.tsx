        <h2 id="terms-accounts-01">User Accounts</h2>

          activity that occurs under it. Provide accurate information, keep your profile current,
          and notify us of any unauthorized use.

        <h2 id="terms-bidding-01">Bidding Rules</h2>
        <p>
          Bids are intended to be binding offers to purchase. Do not place bids you cannot honor.
          Sellers may set reserve prices and minimum increments. Boliyan may remove bids or listings
          that violate these terms.

        <p>
          Sellers must provide accurate item descriptions, disclose material defects, and fulfill
          accepted bids promptly. Misrepresentation or failure to complete a transaction may result
          in account restrictions.
        </p>

        <h2 id="terms-prohibited-01">Prohibited Items</h2>
        <p>
          You may not list or bid on items that are illegal, unsafe, counterfeit, or otherwise
          prohibited by applicable law. We reserve the right to remove such listings without notice.
        </p>

        <h2 id="terms-termination-01">Termination</h2>
        <p>
          We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms or create risk for the
          community. You may stop using Boliyan at any time by discontinuing access to the service.
